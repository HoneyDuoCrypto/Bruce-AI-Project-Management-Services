  description: Comprehensive stress testing and optimization of Bruce system under
    complex, real-world scenarios
  context:
    background: 'Bruce has been successfully migrated and is now portable. Phases
      1 & 2 are complete with

      15/15 tasks (100%). We now need to validate Bruce can handle complex, real-world
      scenarios

      and optimize performance for production use. This includes multi-project management,

      concurrent usage, large task volumes, and edge cases that could break the system.

      '
    vision: '- Bruce handles 100+ tasks across 10+ phases without performance degradation

      - Concurrent multi-user scenarios work flawlessly

      - Complex dependency chains are tracked accurately

      - System remains stable under stress with graceful error handling

      - Blueprint generation works with large datasets

      - Configuration system scales to enterprise scenarios

      - True production-ready reliability and performance

      '
    decisions_made: '- Focus on stress testing over new features

      - Test with realistic data volumes (not toy examples)

      - Validate multi-project concurrent usage scenarios

      - Performance benchmarks must be quantified and measurable

      - Error handling must be robust and user-friendly

      - All optimizations must maintain backward compatibility

      - Documentation generation must scale to large projects

      '
    constraints: '- Cannot break existing functionality (15 completed tasks)

      - Must maintain config system compatibility

      - Performance targets: <2s page loads, <5s blueprint generation

      - Memory usage must remain reasonable for typical VPS

      - All tests must be reproducible and automated where possible
