  description: Comprehensive stress testing and optimization of Bruce system under
    complex, real-world scenarios, plus enhanced task-centric session tracking
  context:
    background: Bruce has been successfully migrated and is now portable. Phases 1
      & 2 are complete with 15/15 tasks (100%). We now need to enhance Bruce with
      intelligent task-centric session tracking for seamless Claude handoffs, then
      validate Bruce can handle complex, real-world scenarios and optimize performance
      for production use. This includes multi-project management, concurrent usage,
      large task volumes, and edge cases that could break the system.
    vision: '- Enhanced task-centric session tracking captures complete context per
      task - One task = one session with intelligent change tracking and auto-commit/push
      - Headers and comments provide semantic context for AI handoffs - Claude instructions
      enable seamless AI-assisted development - Bruce handles 100+ tasks across 10+
      phases without performance degradation - Concurrent multi-user scenarios work
      flawlessly - Complex dependency chains are tracked accurately - System remains
      stable under stress with graceful error handling - Blueprint generation works
      with large datasets - Configuration system scales to enterprise scenarios -
      True production-ready reliability and performance'
    decisions_made: '- Implement task-centric session tracking instead of conversation
      tracking - One task = one complete session with atomic commits - Headers capture
      why/what context, comments only describe functions - Auto-commit/push on task
      completion with intelligent commit messages - Focus on stress testing enhanced
      system under real-world conditions - Test with realistic data volumes (not toy
      examples) - Validate multi-project concurrent usage scenarios - Performance
      benchmarks must be quantified and measurable - Error handling must be robust
      and user-friendly - All optimizations must maintain backward compatibility -
      Documentation generation must scale to large projects'
    constraints: '- Cannot break existing functionality (15 completed tasks) - Must
      maintain config system compatibility - Session tracking must be completely project-isolated
      - Auto-git operations must handle conflicts gracefully - Performance targets:
      <2s page loads, <5s blueprint generation - Memory usage must remain reasonable
      for typical VPS - All tests must be reproducible and automated where possible
      - Enhanced system must work seamlessly with existing CLI and web UI'
